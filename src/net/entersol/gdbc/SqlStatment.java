/**
 * This class creates sql statements that is ready to be sent by {@link Gdbc} the queries are two types:
 * direct and indirect direct query is simple, it just send plain sql from client to server,
 * indirect queries are queries saved in the server as array the client just send index and complementary arguments
 * 
 * The format of the sending string is like that "index#col; [complementary#col;]*"  
 * while complementary can be
 * a- single field; example  name
 * b- multi fields;  example name1#com; name2#com; name3
 * c- single value; example value
 * d- multi values; value#com; 'value'#com; value
 * e- single equation; example 1) name #eql; value 2) name #gte; 'value'
 * f- multi equations; example 1) `name` #nql; value #and; `name2` #nql; 'value1'  
 * 		2) field #gth; 'val' #and; #not; #opr; field #gte; 33 #cpr;
 * 
 * for using these operators you can use available public fields of this class
 *  they should be in this format for security reasons
 *  
 *  This class sends an object of Json to the {@link Gdbc} in this format 
 *  {
 *  	method: string , //direct or indirect
 *  	sql: string // the sql statement
