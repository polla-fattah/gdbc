/**
 * This class gives a standard gate to all services to communicate with GWT client it uses two variables for output and error
 * ot communicate over HTTP(S), if tere is error then sends it.
 * This class supports communication between client and server using JSON to communicate  data, status, and control messages
 * With this class get and post requests can be made.
 * This class supresses every output from any service just sends its own data, evry other services should use this
 * class as a gate to communicate data and error messages
 * Also its possible to have public or private messages which means by public is anonymous persons and with private
 * Authorized user by name and password.
 * It is also possible to encrypt data that should be sent across the communication but it is recommended to use
 * HTTPS if it is possible because it is faster, cleaner and more standardized
